I have created this blog in order to keep notes and information on different projects I am working on. Projects that I am currently working on include learning cyber security through sites like <a href="https://tryhackme.com">TryHackMe</a> and deploying a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a>. Follow along with me as I learn and create new things!
